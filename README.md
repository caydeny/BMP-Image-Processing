# BMP Image Processing

This project handles BMP files by parsing metadata and displaying details such as pixel width, height, file size, and bits per pixel. Users can adjust parameters like pixel brightness through YUV color manipulation, reduce file size via scaling, and remove specific color channels. All of this processing is done in real time for an interactive experience.

Here are some example images showing the project in use:
